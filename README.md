# inferplot

Inferplot is basically [ggstatsplot](https://indrajeetpatil.github.io/ggstatsplot/index.html), but for Python.

I'm in the process of building a PoC to find out which library to use, to think about what form the graphs should take and so on. Any feedback is welcome (especially about the name, I'm not a big fan of inferplot).

## Current status/ideas

- narwhals to handle dataframes
- matplotlib/seaborn to handle plots
- scipy to handle stats

Ideally, those should be the only dependencies.

The project is still in very early stages, so contributions are not possible yet.
